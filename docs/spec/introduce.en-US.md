Ant Financial has a large number of enterprise-level products. With complex scenarios, designers and developers often need to respond fast due to frequent changes in product demands and concurrent R & D workflow. Many similar contents exist in the process. Through abstraction, we could obtain some stable and highly reusable components and pages.

On the other hand, with the trend of commercialization, more and more enterprise products begin to pursue better user experiences. Under this situation, Ant User-Experience Design Team builds a design system for enterprise products based on four design values of Natural, Certain, Meaningful, and Growing. It aims to uniform the user interface specs and reduce redundancies and excessive production costs, helping product designers to focus on better user experience.
